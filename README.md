# TimeWeaver

Is a generator of multi-sourced sequential data for analytic and machine learning use cases. It is designed to read from
data primarily stored in CSV files and it outputs data in CSV format for analysis.

The use case this is being tested is on sequence data from health records where there are multiple sources.
